# What was the name of my mother? Where and when was she born?

My mother, who you call Mima, was born Antonie Aaron in 1939 in New Brunswick, New Jersey.She loooked just like you as a baby.

Mima's parents were Maurice and Vivian, my grandparents. Maurice ran a plumbing sipply business and Vivian was an artist.\

Mima was given the nickname of 'Toni' by her grandmother. Who called her that as a little girl.

Mom's height is 5'1", the same as your mother. When she was young she had lovely brown hair and brown eyes, just like you. She was considered very pretty, just like you.

In school Mima was a very good student. She typically got straight A's. On the rare occasion she didn't get perfect scores she would weep for hours. While not competitive like you and me, I think she competed in grades. It is a very useful habit to develop.

Mima loves telling stories. She often tells the same stories many times. She will tell you her stories many times, just like she did for me and everyone. You will also hear how much Mima loves you and how much she loves your mother.

For all that Mima is smart, she often thinks she is not. It is not a good habit to develop. Never think you cannpt do something, for you have great intelligence.

# What was the name of my father? Where and when was her born?

My father, who you call Grandpa Ted was born in 1936 in Wilmington, Delaware. He was born Theodore Greenfeld, but everyone called him Ted. His actual birth name is Teyuha.

Grandpa Ted's parents were Izzy and Anna. They ran a tailer shop, and grandpa grew up above the store. 

Grandpa Ted was six feet tall and looked somewhat like me. He was a dreamer, full of ideas. His execution could have been better, but his successfules made up for his failures.

He had many jobs in his life, but most of all wanted to be a write and poet. His last business was writing resumes and CVs to help other people get jobs.
