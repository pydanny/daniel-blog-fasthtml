# Books I've Written

Writing is a passion of mine. Here are my published books. Most are
co-authored with my wife, Audrey.

## [Technical](/books/tech)

With Audrey, I co-write dairy-themed technical books....

## [Fiction](/books/fiction)

I also write fiction, also mostly with Audrey. Dairy isn't mentioned in any of them.
