These are employers who I can confirm are good to work for, who take care of their people. They are lead by people with a strong sense of ethics and try to do good for the world. To be more succinct: these are places I would consider working.

Employers that focus in particular on decarbonization and other aspects of climate change are listed first, and get Earth emoji (🌎🌍🌏) by their name.

In fact, Six Feet Up has a formal initiative they call [IMPACTFUL](https://sixfeetup.com/company/our-mission#objective) that is inspirational. More organizations should choose to take positive action in this manner.
