title: Two Scoops of Django 1.5 Beta Released
---

After thirty four days of hard work, [Audrey](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com)
and I are proud to announce that we've released the **beta** of [Two
Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
1.5](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5). It's been a monumental effort, a labor
of love, and we hope you find our efforts worthy. You can buy it right
now in e-book (PDF) form on the website: <https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5>

Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5 is a compilation of
best practices for the Django framework. Like any framework, Django has
tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't documented in one place.
Experienced developers know this stuff, but gleaning it off the Internet
takes a lot of time. We decided to take everything we know and write it
down.

We stand of the shoulders of giants: We received advice from Django
experts including a BDFL, Django core developers, and subject matter
experts from around the world. Reader contributions from advanced and
beginning developers have also shaped the book, and we can't thank
enough those who gave us their insights.

What is different about the beta release?
=========================================

- Added 50+ pages of content while reducing the file size from 5.1 MB
  to 1.5 MB.
- Added list of tables, list of figures, and an index.
- Dramatically improved the chapters on security, testing, logging,
  admin, and many more.
- Added so many more code samples that even with the new example
  numbering system we lost count.
- Speaking of code examples, most of the code samples in the book are
  loaded directly out of fully tested projects.
- Incorporated the feedback of dozens of readers. Thank you so much
  for your contributions!

# What does buying the beta get me?

- Access the PDF version of the book.
- Access to the Kindle and ePub formats when we release the final.
- Access to final release of the book.

# Why aren't there Kindle or ePub versions yet?

We want to support more formats, but won't do it poorly. It's going to
take us at least several days to render the book in an alternative
format that looks good. Since we both have multiple presentations at the
upcoming [PyCon US](https://us.pycon.org/2013/), we simply don't have
time to get it done.

# If I bought the alpha do I have to buy the beta?

Alpha buyers get full access the beta. In fact, you should have already
received an email with a link to the latest version. If that hasn't
arrived, please email us at <2scoops@cartwheelweb.com>.

# Is this book good for beginners?

The response from beginning Django developers reading it has been
**unbelievably, overwhelmingly positive**. This is the book we wanted to
have when we learned Django, and we're honored by the response the book
has received.

Since the book isn't a tutorial, we ask that before beginners purchase
it, they [learn the fundamentals of](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/)
[Python](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914/?ie=UTF8&tag=ihpydanny-20)
and take the [official Django
tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.5/intro/tutorial01/).

When beginners find sections of the book above their head, they do what
everyone does when reading a technical reference: skip over challenging
sections until they have enough grounding to understand.

If any beginners are confused by our explanations, or have difficulties,
please email us at <hello@roygreenfeld.com>. We'll do our best to
answer your questions. Your issues provide invaluable insight into what
we need to improve.

# Is this book good for experienced developers?

We've done our best to provide worthwhile material for developers of
all levels. In fact, a lot of intermediate to advanced developers have
said they've found good things to use in our book. Many have also found
that by using our book as a supplementary manual, it helps them their
team work better.

# Is this book going to get updated?

Absolutely!

During the **alpha** we updated the book multiple times before knuckling
down on the **beta** rewrite. Even after the final version comes out,
we'll continue to update the book. One of the advantages of
self-published e-books is we have total control of content.

# When can I get a print version?

After a lot of consideration, we've decided to hold off on the print
version of the book until what we call the
[final](/two-scoops-beta-released.html#final)
release, which won't be released until after [PyCon
US](https://us.pycon.org/2013/). We're very finicky and don't want
buyers of the print version to have an unfinished book.

# Tutorial? PyCon? Are you going?

Yes! We're going to be at PyCon next month! We're giving the [Wiring
Up Django Packages](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/)
tutorial, and [Kenneth Love](https://brack3t.com/) (of [Getting Started
with Django](https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/) fame) is part of our
team.

While tickets to PyCon itself are sold out, you can still [register for
the tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/).

# When is the book's final release?

The final release won't occur until after PyCon.

Our plan for the final release of Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices
for Django 1.5 is to focus on errata, alternative electronic formats,
and the print version.

# Can we purchase the book in bulk?

We're working on a program to provide organizations the capability to
purchase many e-copies and keep the recipients of the book updated
constantly. We hope to have this ready in a few days.

# Can I buy the book via PayPal?

No. I've answered in full
[here](/we-are-not-using-paypal.html).

We're considering other non-credit card options to handle payment.

# Known Issue Warnings

## Copy/Paste

There are problems with copy/pasting of code from the PDF. The new build
process is turning the code examples into some sort of image type of
object, which explains the strange characters. We're working on it, but
aren't sure how long the fix will take.

## Android

On Android, if you try to open the PDF directly from the Gumroad
download, you might get a "Cannot open file" error; however, if you
navigate to the download location on your phone/tablet with a file
browser (e.g. Samsung's "My Files"), you should be able to open the
file from there. Gumroad is currently investigating the issue.

# Where should I send errata or suggestions?

Please send errata to <hello@roygreenfeld.com>. We try to respond
personally to every request.
