title: My PyCon 2012 Schedule
---

Here I was thinking that this year's PyCon wasn't going to be so busy
because I didn't submit a talk or tutorial. Ha! What the heck was I
thinking?

Here's what I've already got in the works.

# Wednesday, March 7th

Me and Audrey are driving up from Los Angeles. I've wanted to do this
drive for a while, so this is very exciting. We'll arrive in the
evening and hopefully tag up with friends old and new.

# Thursday, March 8th

I'm moderating the Code Reuse panel of the Python Web Summit. [Have you
submitted a question
yet](https://www.google.com/moderator/#15/e=1c9a94&t=1c9a94.43)?

In the evening we'll be helping assemble bags for the conference.
That's always a blast.

# Friday, March 9th

PyCon really begins! I'll be at the keynotes, and then the talks begin.
These are some of the talks I'm really leaning towards watching:

- [Introduction to
  Metaclasses](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/64/)
- [The Art of
  Subclassing](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/399/)
- [Data, Design,
  Meaning](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/249/)
- [Code Generation in Python: Dismantling
  Jinja](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/246/)

The problem, of course, is that all the talks look awesome. Missing some
of these talks is going to hurt.

In the evening we're going to the New Relic/Loggly/Skull Candy party
and hang out at the (in)famous TIP BOF.

# Saturday, March 10th

I'll be at the [Consumer Notebook](https://consumernotebook.com)
[Startup
Row](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2012/02/startup-row-winners-for-pycon-2012.html)
booth all day! Come and hang out with us and all the other bright, new
companies.

In the evening I'm hosting the [PyCon Capoeira Open
Space](https://us.pycon.org/2012/community/openspaces/capoeira/). We've
got a seriously large room assigned for the event, and over twenty five
people currently signed up to participate ([there's still room for
signups](https://bit.ly/pycon-capoeira)). Even if you don't want to play
a musical instrument or learn/play at Capoeira, come anyway to watch.
Some of the players there have some seriously amazing skills - I can
assure you've seen them in the movies.

# Sunday, March 11th

More talks!

- [Transifex](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/482/)
- [Sketching a better
  product](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/301/)
- [Building A Python-Based Search
  Engine](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/66/)
- [Diversity in
  practice](https://us.pycon.org/2012/schedule/presentation/168/)

# Monday March 12 - Thursday, March 15

Sprints! Nothing set in stone yet, but some ideas I've had include:

- Launch python.opencomparison.org for all of Python.
- OpenComparison integration of PyPI OpenID, SourceForge OAUTH, and
  BitBucket OAUTH.
- Improved OpenComparison integration of the Launchpad API.
- Implement Gitorious API for OpenComparison.
- Implement Text Based search for OpenComparison.
- Hack on Mongo related technologies such as django-mongonaut and some
  other planned projects.
