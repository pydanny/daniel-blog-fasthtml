[![Los Angeles Open Source Sprint](/images/7132778527_6e3b49b313_o.png)](https://www.flickr.com/photos/pydanny/7132778527/)

This is a day long coding event in Los Angeles for Open Source
developers of all languages and skill levels to come and code like
fiends. They'll be joined by dozens of either really smart coders or
nice people like me. Sponsors are providing food, drinks, venue, and
more!

RSVP at <https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/> before it
fills up! It's free.

I'll be there to:

- Organize the event with the assistance of the awesome Los Angeles
  technical community!
- Code like a fiend. I want to work on django-mongonaut and could use
  some GraphViz and JavaScript help.

And now to open the floor to questions...

# Where and when?

Where:

    Spire.io
    7257 Beverly Blvd #210
    Los Angeles, CA 90036

When:

    May 12, 2012
    10 AM to 10 PM

# Is this like a Hackathon?

Yup. See <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon#Sprints>

# Will there be Wifi?

Yes!

# I'm just starting as a developer, should I come?

It depends.

**If you've never coded before**, this isn't the right place. Instead,
you might consider one of the local coding workshops or classes. In
fact, here's a good [bi-weekly hack night / study
group](https://www.meetup.com/Los-Angeles-Hack-Night/) for you.

**If you've done a tutorial or two**, sprints can be a great way to
learn new skills or hone your technique by sitting alongside experienced
developers who actually need your help. A lot of projects have what are
called 'low hanging fruit', which are 'simpler' tasks saved for
beginner developers to wet their teeth on. Things I've learned at
events like these include Git, Mercurial, JQuery, and a hundred other
things that have made me a better coder.

# What if I don't have a project of my own to bring? Should I come?

Heck yeah! There will be a number of projects around that you can join
and contribute to in order to make the world a better place. There
isn't a list up yet, but I'm hoping by Saturday there will be one.

# What if I want to come and recruit people?

**Absolutely not**.

This is not a job fair and we don't want unnecessary distractions.

On the other hand, if you want to help sponsor we'll happily mention
you on the
[meetup.com](https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/)
description.

# Are there going to be any presentations or lightning talks?

No.

This is a sprint, not a conference or demonstration. We'll try and
limit announcements and interruptions as much as possible, the only
exception being for letting you know food has arrived.

# What should I bring?

Your own functioning laptop with power cord. Neither event organizers,
the venue, or sponsors are providing equipment. We also encourage you to
bring a power strip labeled with your name.

# I'm sold! How much does it cost and where do I register?

The event costs you nothing and you RSVP at
<https://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/>.
