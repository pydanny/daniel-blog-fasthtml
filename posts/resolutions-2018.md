Happy New Year!
===============

The last time I wrote down resolutions was way back in 2014. I had done
it for many years at that point, dating back to even before my old blog.
Somehow I fell out of what I consider a positive habit. Well, it's time
to pick it up again!

So here are my resolutions for 2018:

1.  Weight down to 160.
2.  Work out for 60 minutes a day. I got lazy in the last year.
3.  Start martial arts again. Because of knee and ankle injuries,
    Capoeira is probably right out. Already up Kali/Escrima under
    [Guro](https://valleycapoeira.com/about-us/contra-mestreguro-xingu/)
    Mestre Xingú instead.
4.  Write at least 3 books (last year we did 5 books, so this is
    doable!). Out of those, one will be about coding in some way.
5.  Blog at least once a month, about anything. Python, Django,
    serverless coding, martial arts, whatever. And with this post,
    January is done!
6.  Release some coding projects I can't talk about yet.
7.  Travel outside the USA. That looks to be a trip to Colombia to speak
    at [PyCon Colombia](https://www.pycon.co)! If you are in South
    America, please meet me (and Audrey) there! I'll be sharing more
    details soon. :-)

note: The photo is from a light painting session I did with Audrey at
the start of last year.
