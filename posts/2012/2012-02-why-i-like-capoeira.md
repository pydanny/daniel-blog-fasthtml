title: Why I like Capoeira
---

*This was originally posted on blogger [here](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/2012/02/why-i-like-capoeira.html)*.

In June 2010 I started [Capoeira](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira) while in Lawrence, Kansas under [Celso Wills](https://www.facebook.com/pages/Capoeira-dos-Palmares/177057772341910). I stopped for a few months after moving to Los Angeles in November of 2010. I picked it up again in the spring under Contra [Mestre](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUJfqJFKmzI) [Xingu](https://valleycapoeira.com/?page_id=7) and have been training under him ever since at [Valley Capoeira](https://valleycapoeira.com/). I go as much as possible every week, each session usually being about 2 grueling hours with the heat in the gym turned up as high as possible. Why? Because it's about:


- Fun! I love doing Cartwheels!
- Strength.
- Endurance.
- Agility.
- Flexibility.
- Weight control.
- Personal Challenge.
- Showing off.
- Learning new moves I never imagined before I began.
- Trying to stop being the member of my family who can't play musical instruments.
- Overcoming my fears of singing in public.
- Showing them whippersnappers how us old people do it.
- Making new friends and joining a community.
- Playing in the [roda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capoeira#Roda) with all my new friends. :-)
- Having several hours a day where I get to just be a complete newbie and work my butt off.


<h3>Capoeira at PyCon?</h3>
Anyone up for trying or doing Capoeira at [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org)? Let me know either here or at [@pydanny](https://twitter.com/pydanny) and if I get enough people I'll get my Mestre to teach a session and give a demo!

<h2>Salve!</h2>

Very cool! Art brings balance to our scientific minds.
