title: Two Scoops of Goblins
---

While [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](https://audrey.feldroy.com) and I were
contemplating our next Two Scoops Press book topic, it came down to a
decision between Pyramid, Flask, and mythical creatures. Inspired by
Django's magical flying pony, Pyramid's scary alien dude, and even the
idea of a magical Flask pouring out wonderful projects, we've decided
to go with mythical creatures.

Specifically, we're writing about goblins, hence the title of this blog
post.

What that means is that the next book we publish will be fantasy. Going
forward all the books we write will be fiction.

If we ever write a new [Two Scoops of
Django](https://feldroy.com)
book, it will be a fantasy about a magical flying pony who eats ice
cream. That way we'll confuse the [already muddled Amazon.com search
requests for
'Django'](https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss_2?url=search-alias%3Daps&field-keywords=django&tag=mlinar-20)
even more.
