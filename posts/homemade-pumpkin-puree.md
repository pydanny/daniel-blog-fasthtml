title: Homemade Pumpkin Puree
description: How I make the base for pies and other yummy concoctions.
---

I'm of the opinion that homemade pumpkin puree is better than what
comes out of a
[can](https://www.amazon.com/Farmers-Market-Organic-Pumpkin-15-Ounce/dp/B0062A87HA/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20).
Some people disagree with me, but I argue that the delicate, sensitive
flavor of pumpkin is easy to overwhelm. Simply put, if you overload it
with sugar and/or that mixture of cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, cloves and
allspice called [pumpkin
spice](https://www.amazon.com/Culinary-Secrets-Pumpkin-Pie-Spice/dp/B00OGNFZA2/ref=sr_1_14?tag=mlinar-20),
canned is going to taste identical (if not better).

Before you belabor the point of homemade versus canned, the same
argument for overloading quality ingredients with sugar and spices can
be made for coffee, tea, flour, steak, etc.

In any case, homemade pumpkin puree is really easy to make. At home, my
[wife](https://audrey.feldroy.com) and I use it as the base for all our
pumpkin dishes.

## Ingredients

- **1 pie pumpkin** _(You can substitute regular pumpkins, but pie
  pumpkins are easier and taste better)_
- **1 tablespoon of olive oil**

## Instructions

First, get out your [cutting
board](https://www.amazon.com/Microban-Antimicrobial-Cutting-Board-Green/dp/B00BM9939C/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20)
and [french
knife](https://www.amazon.com/Victorinox-Fibrox-8-Inch-Chefs-Knife/dp/B000638D32/ref=zg_bs_289857_1?tag=mlinar-20).

Cut the pumpkin in half. Don't worry about getting the halves perfectly
equal, it doesn't matter. What does matter is being careful with your
knife!

I start with the point of the knife, puncturing into the middle. Then I
carefully slice around the whole pumpkin, keeping the point in the
middle. It does take a little bit of effort, but so does carving a jack
o-lantern.

Once halved the pumpkin should look like the photo below. Note how the
edges aren't perfect!

Set the over to 350 degrees fahrenheit, or about 176 degrees celsius.

Scoop out the seeds into a [mixing
bowl](https://www.amazon.com/iSi-Basics-Flexible-Silicone-Mixing/dp/B000S17WNO/ref=sr_1_7?tag=mlinar-20).
You can use a spoon or your hand. Don't worry about getting the stringy
material out of the pumpkin. It's perfectly edible and provides a
slightly stronger pumpkin flavor when you are done.

In a future recipe I'll describe how you can roast the seeds.

Spread the spoonful of [olive
oil](https://www.amazon.com/California-Olive-Ranch-Extra-Virgin/dp/B004ULUVU4/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20)
on the parts of the halved pumpkin touched by the french knife. The goal
is to not have the pumpkin stick to the [cookie
sheet](https://www.amazon.com/Nordic-Ware-Natural-Aluminum-Commercial/dp/B000G0KJG4/ref=sr_1_1?tag=mlinar-20)
while also not overwhelming the delicate flavor with olive oil.

Put the pumpkin halves face down on the cookie sheet then place that in
the oven.

In about 45-60 minutes the pumpkins will be done. The skin of the
pumpkin should be a little darker and perhaps take on mottling.

Wait about 5-10 minutes for the pumpkin to cool. Then peel off all the
skin and throw it away. In the photo below you can see where I took the
stem of the pumpkin and just pulled off the skin. The little hole in the
pumpkin flesh itself is where we tested the flavor with a spoon (it was
yummy).

Using a big spoon, scoop the cooked pumpkin into another mixing bowl. In
this case, we dumped it right into the soup pot. It will fall apart in
the process, but that's okay!

Puree the pumpkin! We prefer the [immersion
blender](https://www.amazon.com/Cuisinart-HB-155PC-Blender-Blending-Attachments/dp/B00DOK0R2O/ref=sr_1_3?tag=mlinar-20)
as it's less setup/cleanup than a food processer or blender. Not to
mention you can do it right in the soup pot.

Use the puree in something yummy! Here we used homemade pumpkin puree,
milk, chicken stock, and spices to make an healthy, savory pumpkin soup.
It's been dressed with a dab of sour cream and roasted pumpkin seeds.

Yes, I'll be documenting our pumpkin soup recipe in a future blog post.
