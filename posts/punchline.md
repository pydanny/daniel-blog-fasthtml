Last year on April 1st [I wrote how the next Two Scoops Press book would
be about goblins](/two-scoops-of-goblins.html).
Naturally, many interpreted this as an April Fool's Day prank. Also
naturally, I didn't agree or disagree with this interpretation of my
blog post.

Well, it's time to unveil the the punchline, as it were, for last
year's April Fool's Day post. Are you ready for it? Here goes...

The punchline is that blog post wasn't a joke or prank. Indeed,
yesterday I released my first fiction book, a dark fantasy novel with
goblins in it.

[![Into the Brambles Cover](/images/itb.png)](https://www.amazon.com/into-the-brambles-ebook/dp/B00VC5UQHO/?tag=the-brambles-20)

Description:

_The world was ancient, scarred from a thousand wars between gods,
immortals, and heroes. Old grudges have faded but are not forgotten._

_At the end of a so-called 'age of peace', two great nations of
immortals march against each other, with humanity caught in the middle.
In this world of conflict, three very different individuals are thrust
into the face of danger._

_Here a young man is marched off to war, a noble woman takes charge of
her own destiny, and in the depths of the Haunted Lands a dark king is
born. Their fates will shake the foundations of the universe._

If you would like to buy my book, you can do so on
[Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/into-the-brambles-ebook/dp/B00VC5UQHO/?tag=the-brambles-20)
for the introductory price of $2.99, the same price as a cup of coffee
in the USA. The book is also in the Kindle Unlimited program, at least
for now.
