[![Original TSD Book Cover](/images/tsd15-alpha.png)](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5/)

We ([Audrey Roy](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com/) and I) wrote a
[book](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5) on Django! It's called **Two Scoops
of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.5**, and you can buy it right now
in e-book (PDF) form on the website: <https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5>.

Django, like any framework, has tips, tricks, and pitfalls that aren't
documented in one place. Experienced developers know this stuff, but
gleaning it off the Internet takes a lot of time. We decided to take
everything we know and write it down. This
[book](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5) reflects a portion of what we
documented, and if it does well we plan to follow it up with other
references.

If you've followed this blog or watched our talks you've know we've
explained tons of Django and Python related examples. We enjoy using
Django and Python to build stable, fast web applications quickly and
efficiently. This is the [book](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5) we would have
wanted while learning the intricacies of our tools, and then kept it
handy for reference.

In the [book](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5) we cover everything from
customizing the Django 1.5 User model, forms, views, templates,
security, bottleneck analysis and so much more. We tie in third-party
packages from the Django and Python community. We discuss the positive
patterns that allow for rapid development, and point out the
anti-patterns that cause problems. The result isn't a walk-through or
tutorial, but a reference guide for anyone with at least a basic
understanding of Django.

We tried to make the code copy/pastable, but we are constrained by the
limits of PDF. While the code examples display nicely, _when pasting
from Adobe Reader the leading white spaces vanish_. We apologize and ask
if anyone knows how to address this issue to let us know at
<hello@roygreenfeld.com>.

Even with an amazing cadre of technical reviewers, there is always the
possibility of errors. We are going to be actively maintaining the
[book](https://roygreenfeld.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5), so if you find a mistake, let us know
and we'll update it and send out an updated copy of the PDF to all
buyers.
