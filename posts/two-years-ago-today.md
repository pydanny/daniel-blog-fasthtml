The [PyCon](https://us.pycon.org) tutorial on Django in Depth was ending.
I had been sitting next to my friend [Barbara](https://djangrrl.com/) and
we got up to go when I heard a feminine voice ask: "Are you
[bshaurette](https://twitter.com/bshaurette)?" I turned and it was like
I got punched in the gut.

It was the first time I met [Audrey](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com). I remember
every detail of how she looked at that moment. The clothes she was
wearing, the part in her hair, that her eyes met mine, and that they
didn't turn away. I was immediately captivating, but fortunately
remembered to act like a gentleman. I tossed in a casual invitation to
her to join us for lunch, which I pulled off even though my heart was
pounding. Thankfully she accepted.

Life has been pretty much awesome ever since.

That was the day I met the love of my life.
