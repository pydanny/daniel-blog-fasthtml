We (Audrey Roy and I) just released the **revised**, **expanded**, and
**slightly renamed** second edition of our book on Django. It's called
[Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django
1.6](https://feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6), and
you can buy it right now in print format on our [online
store](https://feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6) or
[Amazon.com](https://amzn.to/1n98duC).

Two Scoops of Django: Best Practices for Django 1.6 is chock-full of
even more material that will help you with your Django projects. We'll
introduce you to various tips, tricks, patterns, code snippets, and
techniques that we've picked up over the years. We have put thousands
of hours into writing and revising its hundreds of pages of concise,
example-packed text.

## Why Should You Purchase the Second Edition?

> "I read the first edition cover to cover. The second one raises the
> bar again. It's pedagogical, entertaining, and thoughtful."
>
> -- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6
> Reviewer

Why should you buy this updated version of our previous book? Well,
it's more than a slight rename, it's been
[revised](https://feldroy.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-6-change-list)
and
[expanded](https://feldroy.com/pages/two-scoops-of-django-1-6-change-list)!

## It's Revised

Significant portions of the previous material have been revised,
incorporating huge amounts of feedback submitted by our readers over the
past year. We listened to suggestions, clarified existing content, and
incorporated useful tips into the book, carefully curating what went in
and what didn't. Our goal was to make the existing content even more
succinct and worth reading.

> "I disagree with the idea that running tests on SQLite is OK, for the
> same reasons developing on SQLite causes problems."
>
> -- Aymeric Augustin, Django Core Developer, Two Scoops of Django 1.6
> Reviewer

As with writing the previous edition, we asked numerous subject matter
experts on security, databases, deployment and more for their feedback
and advice. We're not afraid to ask questions or to ask the best and
brightest to find fault with our work. It's hard to be told you're
wrong by those who you respect, and even harder to change patterns you
promoted. However, we believe it's our duty to the readers to make our
book the best is can be.

## It's Expanded

> "Can Two Scoops of Django expand the deployment chapter?"
>
> -- Most frequently-asked request

We had countless requests for more content from readers around the
world. People asked us to cover more and more stuff and we've done our
best to comply. We have new material on function-based views, Django
1.6-era transactions, deployment, internationalization, Python 3,
identical environments, and more.

In fact...

### We expanded the book so much that **3 > 4**:

This isn't to say that we padded the book. Not at all. The new material
is packed with our loud volume of code examples and concise
explanations. We would like to think it's awesome, but that's because
we had the whole world helping us put it together.

## We Did It Together

I believe this new edition is amazing. As I said before, we didn't do
it alone, we had you in our corner. By you, I mean the technical
reviewers and readers giving us support and feedback. We did it for you,
the Python and Django developers around the world.

Which means I'm delighted that our latest effort is finally in print.
In my perfect world it gets a thousand five star reviews. ;-)
