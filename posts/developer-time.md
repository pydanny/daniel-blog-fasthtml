This blog post got started with a tweet.

That tweet got retweeted a lot by developers. And system administrators.
And database administrators. And any creative type.

As of December 7th, 2012, it had been retweeted over 500 times, a
personal best. Obviously I struck a chord that resonated with a lot of
people.

# Why did this tweet resonate with so many people?

What I said in that tweet was not new - dozens if not hundreds of others
have tweeted similar thoughts before and gotten many retweets. Heck,
it's been written about in blogs and articles for years, either as a
huge rant or often as an effort to politely educate others on how to set
up a developer/operations/creative shop.

I think this is because developers/engineers/creatives (and good
managers) know that even a tiny distraction to someone "in the zone"
takes more than just the 3-5 minutes it takes for you to finish a
question and get an answer. Plus, because you are trying to remember the
pieces in your head, you won't be able to give this issue your full
attention. Which causes a whole other set of issues.

We know this. Good managers know this. Good companies live off of it.

And yet this remains a huge problem for many of us because the
distractions keep happening. Maybe it's because your manager doesn't
understand this issue, or you have a team mate who can switch in-and-out
of the zone with impunity. Or because you foolishly leave the
chat/IRC/phone on and you get pinged.

How do we fix it?
=================

**We can't.**

I know this sounds depressing, but I'm being realistic. Here's some
reasons that apply:

-   Unless you are fortunate enough to be working on a solo effort, you
    are working with other developers/engineers/creatives. And if they
    can't ask you questions or inform you about critical stuff then you
    or they can waste hours.
-   Meetings, short or long, online or in person, are a necessary part
    of any operation. If not with your boss or underlings, then with
    clients or users.
-   Your boss/co-workers/underlings/kids/pets/parents don't get it that
    you can't be interrupted.
-   As a freelancer, you can't be inaccessible to existing or potential
    clients.

No really, how do we fix it?
============================

Doesn't matter how frequently you ask the the question (or rant about
it), I don't believe this problem can be really solved. However, here
are some possible mitigations:

**1. Maker's Day**

My friend, [Craig
Kerstiens](https://craigkerstiens.com/2011/11/07/how-heroku-works-maker-day/)
describes how [Heroku](https://heroku.com) gives engineers a full day
each week (Thursday) to focus on getting stuff done. No meetings, no
standup, just 100% uninterrupted quiet time to focus on making stuff.

Suggest this at your company and see how it goes!

**2. Blocks of Time**

As of 2010, [Eldarion](https://eldarion.com) broke up their work day into
at least two sizable chunks of uninterrupted activity. Between the
chunks you communicated with co-workers. The advantage of this approach
is if you went down the wrong path or someone had a critical question,
the period between chunks addressed this issue.

In theory this is how a lot of places work (lunch being the break). The
reality is that the distractions often still pile in. For Eldarion it
worked because everyone was remote.

**3. New Desk Location**

If working at an office, asked to be moved to a place with less foot
traffic. The downside to this is you can end up in noisy, cold, dark
places.

**4. New Job**

Switch to a new job that promises less distractions.

Maybe I'm wrong
================

I'm more than happy to be proven wrong.

Maybe there is a way to get 4-6 hours a day of uninterrupted maker's
time every work day.

If you've got any ideas, let me know!
