title: Thoughts on ranting
---

I'll admit it, I love a good rant. I respect those who can give rants
well. I would list the ones I really like, but I'm not sure I want to
deal with the arguments that would follow. ;-)

Of course, as much as I like to read or listen to them, I also like to
give them. As of 11/26/2012 there are 2 on this
[blog](/tag/rant.html) and 26 on my [old
blog](https://pydanny.blogspot.com/search/label/rant).

Unfortunately, I have a problem in giving rants. It ties with this
unfortunate trait I possess where if I let myself get angry I say things
that destroy relationships. No, I'm not giving examples, but there you
are.

So when I do rant, I try to never do so in anger. Especially when it's
the written word. Instead, I try to do so under one of the following
conditions:

-   I need to be a whimsical mood.
-   OR I need to be willing to submit a solution.
-   OR I need to be willing to accept a solution, even if it means work.
-   OR I need to be willing to create a solution.
-   OR the object of the rant must be an easy target to flame.
