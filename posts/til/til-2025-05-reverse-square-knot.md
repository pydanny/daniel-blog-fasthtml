description: A "reverse square knot," also known as a right square knot or reverse reef knot, is essentially a square knot tied in the opposite order. Instead of the first working cord going over the other cords, it goes under them first.

For years I've used a basic square knot to tie my belt in various martial arts. The problem is that while I tie it neatly, it always comes undone. It doesn't matter if was the stand-up striking arts of my younger years or the   grappling-focused Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu I do now - the knot always comes undone.

I knew of a better knot, but I never knew what it was called or how to do it. I heard references to superlock, Gracie knots, and a few other names. I finally today learned that the better knot is officially called a "reverse square knot," also known as a right square knot or reverse reef knot. 

The improved knot is an incredible upgrade, meaning I can focus on my training rather than worrying about my belt coming undone.

Here's the proof of my first good attempt, a photo I took after a **2 hour class where it never came undone**.

*Note: I had just sparred a few rounds and the belt got twisted. Ignore the twists and just admire the still-tied belt.*

If you do a martial art with Judo-style belts (these include Karate, Tae Kwon Do, and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu), I highly recommend you learn this knot. It's a simple change that can make a big difference in your training experience.
