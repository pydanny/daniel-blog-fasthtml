title: Beginner's Guide to PyCon 2013 Part I
---

New to Python and thinking about going to the upcoming [PyCon
US](https://us.pycon.org/2013/) for the first time? You know, that big
[Python](https://python.org) conference taking place near San Francisco
in March?

Or perhaps you signed up already and are getting worried about being
overwhelmed by hundreds of tutorials, talks, and activities?

No worries! This multi-part guide will aid you in getting the most out
of attending one of the best technical conferences on the planet. I'm
going to share how to get through the whole event in good shape and
cover some incredible beginner friendly events.

# The Basics

First off, [register](https://us.pycon.org/2013/registration/register/)
already! PyCon US sold out last year around this time. Don't be left
out in the cold. Buy your ticket now before it's too late!

Now that you've got that done, keep in mind that Python has two days of
[tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/), three days
of [talks](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/talks/), and four days of
[sprints](https://us.pycon.org/2013/community/sprints/). **Nine days of
Python!** The trick is to not get exhausted or sick. Therefore, do the
following every day of the conference:

1.  Take at least one shower. Please.
2.  Eat at least two good meals. Make a point of sitting with different
    people at each meal and introducing yourself. Make new friends!
3.  Get at least three hours of sleep. More if possible because your
    brain is going to go into learning overdrive.

In addition, PyCon US also has a [code of
conduct](https://us.pycon.org/2013/about/code-of-conduct/). I like to
sum it up as, "Act professionally." Whether or not you agree with
codes of conduct for conferences, PyCon US has one and it will be
enforced.

Alright, enough basics, let's get onto tutorials!

# Tutorials

Tutorials take place on March 13th and 14th. They each cost $150 but
are well worth the price. The following are the talks I believe are best
suited for beginners.

## Wednesday Morning

1.  For novice programmers start with Jessica McKellar's [A hands-on
    introduction to Python for beginning
    programmers](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/1/). I
    can vouch that the instructor is amazing, and will jumpstart you on
    the road to being a Python developer.
2.  Are you an experienced developer new to Python? I suggest [Going
    from web pages to web apps with
    Python](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/8/) by
    Asheesh Loroia and Karen Rustad. In 2009 I took a class by Asheesh
    and was impressed by his energy, enthusiasm, and depth of knowledge.
3.  Want to learn Python web that isn't Django? Try out Paul Everitt's
    [Pyramid for
    Humans](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/12/) class.

## Wednesday Afternoon

1.  You simply can't go wrong with David Beazley's [Learn Python
    Through Public Data
    Hacking](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/2/). He's
    the author of [Python Essential
    Reference](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Essential-Reference-4th-Edition/dp/0672329786/?ie=UTF8&tag=ihpydanny-20),
    an amazing instructor, and delivered a PyCon keynote last year.
2.  If you're interested in the web, check out Nathan Yergler's
    [Effective
    Django](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/9/). I can
    assure you that he knows his Django material and is going to deliver
    a great experience.

## Thursday Morning

1.  If you're new to Python, you need to learn the Python environment.
    This means version control, PyPI, test automation, and more. Matt
    Harrison covers this in [Scripting: from Hard-drive to Github to
    PyPI](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/3/)
2.  Getting back to the web, [Fully Test-Driven Web Development with
    Django and
    Selenium](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/10/) is
    another run through the Django tutorial, but done from the test
    driven perspective.
3.  A fascinating tutorial offered at this time is [A Gentle
    Introduction to Computer
    Vision](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/30/). It's
    a great way to learn how Python is used in many creative and
    unexpected ways.

## Thursday Afternoon

1.  Jessica McKellar returns to instruct on how to give back to the
    community with [Contribute with me! Getting started with open source
    development](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/4/).
2.  Want to learn how to program games? Look no further than Richard
    Jones' [Introduction to
    PyGame](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/19/). He's
    taught this class for years, and I can't say enough good things
    about him.
3.  This talk is not meant for beginning Django developers, but it's
    useful anyway. [Kenneth Love](https://gettingstartedwithdjango.com/)
    and [Jacob Kaplan-Moss](https://jacobian.org) are presenting [Wiring
    Up Django
    Packages](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/11/).
