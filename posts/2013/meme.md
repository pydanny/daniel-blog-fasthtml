title: New Year's Meme 2013
---

Inspired by [Alex Clark's
meme](https://blog.aclark.net/2013/12/30/new-years-python-meme-2014/),
here is my own entry into this end-of-year fun.

What's the Coolest Thing You Discovered This Year?
==================================================

Alex had his own focused on Python applications, frameworks, and
libraries. Me, I'm going for a more general approach. This year I
discovered:

LaTeX
-----

That [book](https://www.feldroy.com/books/two-scoops-of-django-3-x) I co-wrote with [Audrey
Roy](https://audrey.feldroy.com)? Written in
[LaTeX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX). It wasn't easy to get
started, even with Audrey as my instructor, but now that I grok it, I
feel extremely empowered. That's because I can do all kinds of awesome,
insane hacks when [Sphinx](https://sphinx-doc.org/) generates PDFs. I
hope I get the chance to show off some of my new madness to the world in
2014.

How to Tie A Bow Tie
--------------------

If you are going to be formal, the [bow
tie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bow_tie) adds an enormous amount of
class. However, clip-ons are considered tacky, especially as it's
considered stylish to loosen the bow tie later in the evening to
demonstrate you aren't wearing that clip.

Of all the stuff I watched on the subject of bow tying, [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5PTLV-L_sk) was the longest and
the best of them all.

**Update 1/4/2014:** I learned this awesome skill because [I wanted to
be classy on my wedding
day](/i-married-audrey-roy.html).

Awesome Foods Around the World
------------------------------

Here's the short-list:

-   [Oscypek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscypek) is a Polish smoked,
    salted cheese that should be exported to the universe. Seriously. If
    you get some, grill it and serve with jelly.
-   In Florence, Italy you can eat Duck Carpaccio and it is heavenly. If
    there is ever a reason to visit Florence, it is Duck Carpaccio.
-   The Croatian King Truffle Bar is an ice cream delicacy you can find
    in any street market freezer. It's multiple shells of chocolate and
    ice cream in an ice cream bar that speaks taste bud breaking volumes
    to at least the American palate.
-   In the Philippines, they combine shaved ice, evaporated milk, purple
    yam ice cream, and tropical fruits into something they call
    [Halo-Halo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halo-halo). It's
    indescribably yummy and the Los Angeles-based Jollibee version
    Anthony Bourdain tried on his show is a pale comparison to the
    fantastic treat I've been lucky enough to devour in Manila.

What New Programming Technique Did You Learn This Year?
=======================================================

Hard to say, but I'll go with Python's context managers. Trying to
find a way to have what I learned see the light of day. Love the
clients, but this is a good reason to try and do more open source work.

Which Open Source Project Did You Contribute to the Most This Year? What Did You Do?
====================================================================================

While I contributed nothing directly to the framework itself, between
our book and numerous open source projects, I guess the answer is
'Django'.

In 2014 I want to switch that focus to Python.

What Are the Top Three Things You Want to Learn Next Year?
==========================================================

-   The new async framework added in Python 3.4.
-   C because I think it will enhance my Python skills.
-   How to be a better person. I think I educated and helped a lot of
    people this year, but I can do better. **Malcolm Tredennick**
    quietly led the way, and with all the help he provided to Audrey and
    I in January for our book, we owe it to his memory to improve the
    lot of developers everywhere.

What is the Top Thing You Wish Someone Would Write Next Year?
=============================================================

Something that gets more women into the top 10 of
[Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/). That amazing women developers and
community leaders in the Python community like [Lynn
Root](https://www.gittip.com/roguelynn/), [Jessica
McKellar](https://www.gittip.com/jessicamckellar/), dare I say
[Audrey](https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/)
[Roy](https://www.gittip.com/audreyr/), and others aren't up there
speaks uncomfortable volumes. Starting today, I'm directing all my
Gittip funds in their direction. Well... not Audrey because she won't
let me, but you get the idea.

What Else?
==========

This year, 2013, was a wonderful year. Everything changed. I hope to
have a summary out today because some fantastically incredible things
occurred. If not, then it will happen next year... err... tomorrow!
;-)
