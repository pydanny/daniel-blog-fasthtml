title: Beginner's Guide to PyCon 2013 Part III
---

This is Part III in a series of blog posts about [PyCon US
2013](https://us.pycon.org/2013/). The goal is to provide a handy
reference guide for first time attendees of the world's largest
[Python](https://python.org) conference. [Part
I](/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-1.html) was
mostly about [tutorials](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/tutorials/),
[Part II](/beginners-guide-pycon-2013-part-2.html)
was mostly about the first day of talks, this third post in the series
will be about the second day of talks.

Early Saturday Morning
======================

The [PyCon 5K Charity Fun Run](https://us.pycon.org/2013/5k/) begins at
7 AM. Registration for this event is seperate from PyCon, and all
proceeds go to the John Hunter Memorial Fund and the American Cancer
Society.

Saturday Morning
================

After breakfast ends at 8:30 am, don't miss 30 minutes of lightning

    tool. Imagine a Python shell that allows you to embed images and
    graphs right into the REPL. Designed by and for scientists, the
    IPython Notebook is useful for developers of all levels. You have to
    see it in action to believe it!

2:35 PM talks
-------------

This is a rough spot because there are four really beginner good talks
by four great speakers happening at the same time. Since all of this are
going to be wonderful presentations, I'm labeling them all as
'must-see'.

-   [Who are we? A sociological analysis of the indigenous Python
    tribe](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/141/) (Jackie
    Kazil) - Journalist and computer scientist at the Library of
    Congress, Jackie Kazil uses her amazing skills to analyze the Python
    community's code bases across thousands of projects to determine
    where we've been as a people and we are going in the future. If you
    want to see how an expert analyzes trends in the Python-verse, this
    is a talk that can't be missed!
-   [Building full-stack scientific applications in
    Python](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/67/) (Luke
    Lee) - Did you know that Python is used in high performance
    scientific applications? Tools like SciPy and NumPy are built on top
    of very robust, optimized C and Fortran libraries. Luke will cover
    their use and also how to present the data using tools like PyQt. If
    you are into big data, you can't miss this talk!
-   [Customizing the Django Admin: The How and the
    Why](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/146/) (Lakshman
    Prasad) - Following my talk is a deep dive into Django's famous
    admin interface. I was fortunate enough to get a sneak preview of
    the talk and I can say with confidence this is going to be an
    incredible presentation. Don't miss it!
-   [Location, Location,
    Location](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/92/)
    (Julia Grace) - Django, via the GeoDjango toolkit has amazing
    support for building GIS based applications. Julia's an experienced
    developer and great speaker, making this a can't miss talk!

3:15 PM talks
-------------

There isn't a beginner-focused talk in this slot, so I'm going to make
this the *roller-coaster* slot. In other words, I'm going to steer you
to the most intensely advanced talk at this time. Attend, buckle in the
safety harness, and drink in the extreme knowledge!

-   [Making Apache suck less for hosting Python web
    applications](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/80/)
    (Graham Dumpleton) - It is not hard to find developers who will tell
    you that Apache sucks for running Python web applications. Is there
    a valid basis to such claims or have they simply been misguided by
    the views of others? Well, Graham understands how Python serves up
    web pages and won't hold back on technical detail.
-   [Numba: A Dynamic Python compiler for
    Science](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/130/)
    (Travis Oliphant, Siu Kwan Lam, Mark Florisson) - Numba is a
    compiler for Python syntax that uses the LLVM library and llvmpy to
    convert specifically decorated Python functions to machine code at
    run-time. It allows Python syntax to be used to do scientific and
    numerical computing that is blazing fast yet tightly integrated with
    the CPython run-time.

4:15 talk
---------

For this time period there is a single talk specifically aimed at
beginners. There are some other useful talks around this time, but they
are aimed at educators and integrators over beginners.

-   [Crypto 101](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/74/)
    (Laurens Van Houtven) - Cryptography is a tricky subject, and the
    goal of this 4:15 PM talk isn't to turn attendees into cryptography
    experts. Instead, you'll have a basic understanding of how some
    common systems compare, and also a sense for detecting and exposing
    snake oil.

4:30 PM talk
------------

-   [Getting Python and Django Through Your Java Shop Front Door (with
    Jython)](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/102/)
    (Frank Wierzbicki) - Work in a Java shop and want to bring in
    Python? Learn how to do it using Jython, the Python implementation
    that works in the JVM!

5:10 PM talks
-------------

-   [MTO On Blast: Using Python's Natural Language Toolkit to Model
    Gossip Blogs](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/138/)
    (Robert Elwell) - Python's powerful Natural Language Toolkit will
    be featured as the presenter gives an overview of Natural Language
    Processing.
-   [What is the Python Software
    Foundation?](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/103/)
    (Brian Curtin) - This talk aims to engage us in thinking about what
    it takes to further Python. Whether it's an idea of code,
    community, or otherwise, it will jumpstart us into helping the very
    positive community that has brought us together for the amazing
    event that is PyCon.
-   [Asset Management in
    Python](https://us.pycon.org/2013/schedule/presentation/128/)
    (Robert Kluin, Beau Lyddon) - Coffeescript, Less, SASS, and all
    those other exciting new front end asset tools can be a challenge to
    deploy when doing web development in tools like Django, Flask, and
    Pyramid. The presenters will introduce *webassets*, a library
    designed to make deployment of assets quick and easy.

Evening Activities
==================

Saturday night will be the evening of a huge number of fantastic fun.
Two items of note (more to come):

-   [The PyCon Charity
    Auction](https://us.pycon.org/2013/sponsors/charityauction/) (6:30
    PM+) - Along with Disney Animation Studios and many others, Audrey
    and I are contributing! In fact, we're submitting a one of a kind,
    preview copy of the upcoming print edition of [Two Scoops of Django:
    Best Practices for Django 1.5](https://feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-5)!
-   The famously unrecorded Testing in Python Birds of a Feathers event.

Part IV
=======

Stay tuned for Part IV of this series where I cover the third day of
talks best suited for new Python developers!
