This weekend we took 4.5-year-old Uma to [Paultons Park amusement park](https://paultonspark.co.uk/) near Southhamption, UK. It was her first real amusement park experience, and she had a grand time.

## The many positives: 

- **The park is really well maintained**. Everything felt clean and proper, at the Disneyland level - if not better
- **The rides for kids were fun and creative**, with supportive and friendly staff
- **The restrooms were clean.** 
- **Peppa Pig World was really fun for our 4.5 year old**. She also enjoyed the Dinosaur area called "Lost Kingdom"
- **The animal enclosures were nice**. Uma really liked the pink flamingo enclosure
- **The water park was a good break from the rides**, fenced in so we knew Uma couldn't run off
- **The playgrounds were fun and accurately marked for different age groups**
- **This park is for kids, not teens**. There are a few roller coasters, but really this is for 12 years or under
- **The mobile app is well executed**, we loved the estimated queue times and the map
- **The food options were decent**, expensive but on the reasonable side for an amusement park. We brought our own food but splurged on ice cream and coffee
- **Getting there by public transit from London was straight-forward**. We took the tube to the Waterloo Station, then a South West train to South Hamption Central. From there we jumped on the X7 bus right to the park entrance

## The single negative item:

**Leaving was unnecessarily unpleasant**

- The last bus from the park entrance to the train station left an hour before the park closed. To be fair, this is a public bus, not part of the park
- There was another public bus stop a mile away from the park whose last bus left right at park closing
- Discovering these details was really hard, the timetable was hidden inside the covered bus stop listed in a hard-to-follow format

## Summary:

- Excellent park, would visit again. Next time we'll take into account that the last available bus leaves an hour before the park closes
- The venue should  provide a shuttle to-and-from the train station for people coming from London without cars
