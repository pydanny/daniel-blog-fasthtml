- Tap early and tap often. Better to train tomorrow then get hurt and be out for a month
- Before you spar with someone, tell your opponent about any injuries
- Go for position and transition instead of submission
- If you lose: smile, and show respect
- If someone smothers you with pressure and you can't get out, don't let it get to your head. Tap and move on with a smile. Part of the BJJ journey is learning how to deal with discomfort 
- If you win: show respect and humility
- Ask questions
- No matter how tired you get, if it's sparring time go as much as you can. The best way to build grappling endurance is get used to it
- If someone's a jerk on the mat, unless they apologize don't train with them again
- Don't be a jerk on the mat, look out for your opponent's welfare
- Don't keep track of wins and losses
- Wash your gi and rashgaurds at the end of your training day
- Choose an accessory fitness method and do it regularly. I do weight lifting and a tiny bit of climbing, lots of others train in yoga. Not just because it might improve your BJJ, but it can help prevent injury and postural issues

Most of these tips I got from my coaches Todd, Ben, and Ellen at [Academy of Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu](https://academyofbrazilianjiujitsu.com/) in Los Angeles, but I also got good advice at [Grand Union BJJ](https://grandunionbjj.com/) in London.
