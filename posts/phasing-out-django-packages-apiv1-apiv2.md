title: Phasing Out Django Packages APIv1 & APIv2
---

It is time to upgrade [Django
Packages](https://www.djangopackages.com/). If you are using the site's
APIs in any way, this affects you.

This site, maintained by myself and [Audrey Roy
Greenfeld](https://audrey.roygreenfeld.com), is the directory of reusable
apps, sites, and tools for Django-powered projects. And the site has
been running on Django 1.4.x for about 2.5 years. Which in internet
years is forever. It's time to upgrade!

Alas, we have a problem.

## The Problem

The first REST API for the project, APIv1 is running on a very old
version of
[django-tastypie](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/django-tastypie/0.9.7)
(0.9.7) which blocks upgrading the Django version, even to Django 1.5.
While we could do a lot of work to migrate upwards to modern
django-tastypie, that would require a lot of time that we would rather
spend adding new features or making other stuff. More importantly, there
are elements to the APIv1's design that we want to change.

While we are on the subject of legacy APIs, the second REST API for the
project, the mostly undocumented APIv2, is powered by a relatively old
version of [Django Rest
Framework](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/djangorestframework/2.3.8)
(2.3.8). The design of APIv2 was a bit of an experiement in
architectural design, one whose novel approach (API views mixed into
standard HTML views instead of seperated out) was unweildy and
ultimately annoying. One might even call it an anti-pattern. That's
fine, as sometimes you have to try things in order to determine better
approaches for later, but it's time for this version of the API to die.

Our eventual goal is to get Django Packages running on Django 1.8 as
well as implementing a brand-new REST API powered by Django Rest
Framework. Getting there is the trick. Hence, we've created "**The
Plan**".

## The Plan

We have a four-stage plan for migrating the site upwards:

1.  On April 2, 2015 we will be turning off APIv1. All endpoints will
    redirect to APIv3.
2.  On April 3, 2015, we will be turning off APIv2. All endpoints will
    stop working.
3.  On April 4, we commence work on migrating the project to Django 1.8.
4.  Whenever we finish #3, we start work on APIv4, powered by Django
    Rest Framework.

### About APIv3

Already implemented, this version of the API is powered by very simple
JSON-powered views. Since both APIv1 and APIv2 only have GET endpoints,
it was easy to roll something out that provided nearly all the data
generated by both previous APIs.

**Update 2014/03/01**: Clarified the design mistake of APIv2.
