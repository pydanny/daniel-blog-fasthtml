## Recap of 2024

- We lived in London
- Spent much more time with my beloved Audrey Roy Greenfeld than I did the previous year. In addition to focusing on working out together a few times a week, we ended up working together again
- Watched with glee as my daughter Uma Roy Greenfeld grew in stature and intellect over the year. I'm so proud of her many accomplishments
- Trained enough in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to earn my blue belt
- Did Tai Chi seriously for the first time since university. If only my schedule had allowed me to continue further 
- Recovered from frozen shoulder
- Presented a keynote at PyCon Lithuania
    - I was first family member to return to that particular homeland in over a hundred years
    - Had the chance to explore Vilnius and other parts of the homeland
    - Many thanks to the awesome Aidis Stukas
- Presented a keynote at PyCon Italy in Florence, my third time speaking in the same venue
- Went to Milan for the first time, seeing my cousin Rose and her lovely family
- Began another year at [Kraken tech](https://kraken.tech), the energy utility software company. Love the mission and people, you all rock!
- Learned a new web framework, [FastHTML](https://fastht.ml/), and began to contribute to it and the surrounding ecosystem
- Rewrote this blog in FastHTML. For the first time in 12 years it isn't mostly static HTML because it no longer needs to be
- Went to Brisbane and Redcliffe Australia. My first visits there and first time back to Down Under in 12 years
- In September I began a year-long sabbatical from [Kraken](https://kraken.tech/), to begin my machine learning & artificial intelligence journey at [answer.ai](https://www.answer.ai/)
- Rebooted my sysadmin knowledge, relearning how to do things without cloud services. Not quite bare metal, but not far off either!
- Refocused my career to be that of learning and discovery, many thanks to Jeremy Howard, Eric Reis, and everyone at Answer.ai
- Blogged significantly more than in 2023, writing 42 articles which was 62% improvement. Most of those in the last four months of the year
- Kept my working schedule sane
- Met in person with Anthony Dale, an old high school friend
- Visited the USA for the end-of-year holidays
- Visited Paris in the autumn
- Visited many new places in England, including Birmingham, Oxford, Cambridge, Brighton, Liverpool, Luton, Alton, and more
- Went to an unbelievable number of museams and children's attractions in five countries. Seeing my daughter's wonder at learning new things is truly wonderful
- Begun the bittersweet move away from London, England to a town near Brisbane, Australia. Once again we are drawn as a family to be in a place where our co-workers are in the same timezone. We leave on a high note but are sad, we have truly enjoyed our time in London.
