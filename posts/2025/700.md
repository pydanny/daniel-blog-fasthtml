This is the seven hundredth sequential article on this site.

What do you write when you hit [700 posts/articles](/posts) over 20 years? Do you recap all the big events around your [wife](/tags/audrey) and [daughter](/tags/uma)? Cover the [writing stats](/writing-stats)? Go over the various engines used to write over the years?

Or do you avoid the navel gazing and keep it short because this is the umpteenth time you've tried to write this out and it is blocking you from writing about other things?

I think I'll go with short. 

Here's to hundreds of more posts in the days/weeks/months/years/decades/centures to come.
