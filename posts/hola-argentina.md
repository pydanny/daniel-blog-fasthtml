title: Hola, Argentina!
---

I'll be arriving in [Argentina](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argentina)
on August 14th. I'll be speaking at [PyDay
Mendoza](https://eventioz.com.ar/e/pyday-mendoza-2014) on August 15th,
and sprinting on August 16th on something
[Audrey](audrey.feldroy.com) and I named the "new library
sprint" (more details to come). On August 22nd, I'll be speaking at
the combined Buenos Aires Python, Django, and PyLadies Argentina meetup.
Between the events I'll be working from the
[Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.com/)/[Eventioz](https://eventioz.com.ar)
Argentina office.

I'm extremely excited. I've wanted to go to Argentina for years. It's
a beautiful country filled with magnificent culture, lovely
architecture, great food, superb wine, and wonderful people. Speaking of
which, I can't wait to finally put faces to people I've gotten to know
over the internet.

Hasta pronto!
