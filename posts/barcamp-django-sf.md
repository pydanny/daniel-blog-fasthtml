## BarCamp Django SF!

On October 4th and 5th [BarCamp Django
SF](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com) will be taking place in the
[Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com) office in San Francisco. [BarCamp
Django SF](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com) is a low-cost,
community-focused event that's different than any previous multi-day
[Django](https://djangoproject.com) conference.

How is [BarCamp Django SF](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com)
different than previous Django conferences and events?

### Speakers are determined at the event

I know what you are thinking. It's something on the line of "*What the
heck?!?*"

It means that if you want to give a talk, you don't need to be an
expert. We don't have an formal, extensive review process. It's a
chance to share ideas and learn something new. You can be just a Django
hobbyist instead of a professional. All you have to be is
**passionate**.

At the event, we'll put up a board with slots for talks. Attendees can
put themselves into these slots for talks. This makes for a fun, fluid
event where new speakers are as welcome as experienced speakers.

While this is meant to be an informal, beginner-friendly event, a
professional level of conduct is still required:

-   Speakers, like all attendees must agree to the code of
    conduct (listed on the [event page](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com)).
-   No sales or recruiting pitches. Don't even try it!

Some attendees planning to be speakers:

-   [Simon Willison](https://twitter.com/simonw) (co-founder of Django,
    co-founder of [Lanyrd](https://lanyrd.com/))
-   [Andrew Godwin](https://twitter.com/andrewgodwin) (South,
    Migrations, etc)
-   [Natalie Downe](https://twitter.com/natbat) (co-founder of
    [Lanyrd](https://lanyrd.com/))
-   [Audrey Roy Greenfeld](audrey.feldroy.com)
    ([Cookiecutter](github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter),
    [MessageBar](https://github.com/audreyr/messagebar), [Two Scoops of
    Django](https://feldroy.com/products/two-scoops-of-django-1-6))
-   Michael Herman ([Real Python](https://twitter.com/realpython))
-   Myself
-   You! We especially welcome people from diverse backgrounds (race,
    gender, age, LGBT, disability, nationality, etc.)

**note:** Since enough people asked me about it, **speaking is not
mandatory** for attendees of BarCamp Django SF.

### BarCamp Django are just $15

Yes, you read that correctly, tickets for this event are just **$15**.
All proceeds from ticket sales are going to the Django Software
Foundation.

What that **$15** gets you:

-   Meals and snacks.
-   A chance to share ideas, learn something new, and network with
    peers.
-   A big speaking room and over 10 smaller rooms for breakout sessions.
-   Security, including enforcement of the code of conduct.
-   Camping! (see below)

### Camping!

On the night of October 4th, you can stay overnight at [BarCamp Django
SF](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com)!

[BarCamp Django SF](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com) is 2 days,
and will run from 10am Saturday morning until 4pm Sunday in the
[Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com) San Francisco office. Doors will be
open throughout the duration of the event and all are welcome to camp
out overnight. If you do plan on camping, you'll need to **bring your
own sleeping bag, blow up beds, pillows & blankets**.

What's really awesome about camping at [BarCamp Django
SF](https://barcampdjangosf.eventbrite.com) is it allows out-of-town
attendees to keep their costs low ($15 event cost vs $200+ hotel
rooms).

**note:** Our definition of 'camping' is staying overnight inside the
Eventbrite office in San Francisco. While you can't pitch a tent, you
don't have to worry about mosquitoes. Some people will stay up all
night, but we'll have quiet areas for those of us who need our 8 hours.

See you there!

**Update 2014/09/13:** Added note that explains speaking is not
mandatory.
