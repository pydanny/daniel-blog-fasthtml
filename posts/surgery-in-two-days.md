title: Surgery in Two Days
---

In two days, Friday, April 4th, I'm going into [laparoscopic
surgery](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laparoscopic_surgery) in order to
correct a double inguinal hernia. If you want to know what that is, you
can read the Not Safe For Work (NSFW) Wikipedia article.

I said it.

I have a hernia.

That was hard.

It's one thing to admit you are sick or have an injury, but it's
another thing to admit you have a lower abdominal injury caused by
lifting too much. Even if 27% of men get it in their lifetime, it's
still hard to admit.

How Did I Get A Hernia?
=======================

Genetic predisposition, not to mention moving a refrigerator. And a
sofa. And much more.

Last year in early April my wife and were given the [chance to work in
Europe](/posts/off-to-europe) for a while. We moved
out of our place and put all our stuff into storage. We don't have that
much stuff, so we decided to do all the packing and moving ourselves.
While I hadn't worked out consistently in a couple of months, I *knew*
I was up for any heavy lifting.

In fact, for all my adult life every once in a while I either moved or
helped friends move their stuff. I'm in pretty good shape, have
endurance, and know how to lift. I'm really flexible too, able to get
low and push up.

For several days Audrey and I packed and moved stuff into the storage
facility. It was hard, sweaty work and we were racing to meet a
deadline. I didn't mind the work or pace at all. For me it's fun to do
hard labor for short periods and this was a blast. I also love pushing
myself physically.

Let's review:

-   Had to move lots of stuff in a few days.
-   Stuff was not gym-style weights, but awkward boxes and furniture.
    Some of it heavy.
-   Love to push myself.

We got it done just in time! Hooray! I was achey and sore, but really
proud of what we did. Something didn't feel quite right *down there*. I
shrugged it off.

Something is Wrong
==================

On the way to Europe I realized something was wrong. I thought it would
go away, especially with good food and exercise. During the journey and
once we arrived, I tried working out, but afterwards I would be in more
discomfort.

No matter. We worked long, hard hours and spent the weekends
sightseeing. It was awesome. We met lots of our online friends. We
attended amazing conferences and events. It was incredible, and I pray I
get to do it again.

Except that all that walking and standing ached. Over a few hours that
ache would turn to pain. I thought it would go away, but it didn't.
Over time it hurt more and more. Often, out with friends, I pleaded
exhaustion. We kept going home early. Actually, I was just in a lot of
pain that I didn't understand.

My pride meant I didn't want to admit I was hurt.

Admitting the Problem and Diagnosis
===================================

On one of our last days in Zagreb, Croatia we took a very long walk. Far
from our lodging the discomfort got so bad that I sat on the ground.
Getting home was a nightmare. That was when we realized something was
really wrong.

We decided to keep walking to a minimum after that. We readied for our
next stop, the beachside city of Split in Croatia.

When we arrived in Split we did a little research and discovered that I
probably had a hernia. We went to a physician, and he confirmed it. He
had me see a surgeon, who confirmed it as well. While he suggested
surgery, he also let us know that just then wasn't a good time - there
was a threat of a nurses' strike in Croatia.

We decided to wait until we got back to the USA and the Affordable Care
Act went into effect. I could wait that long if I was careful abut
exercise and wore a brace. It sucked, because I would have to wait or
pay completely out of pocket.

Ugh.

Waiting was necessary because I didn't want to spend all my earnings
for a time feeding the heartless American insurance bureaucracy
industry.

As soon as it was available we signed up for proper American medical
coverage through the Affordable Care Act. I now have medical coverage! I
went through the necessary appointments and was recommended the surgery
that's going to happen in two days. The operation should take 90
minutes and I'm going home the same day. Two weeks after surgery I'll
be feeling completely normal, and a month after surgery I can carefully
restart my exercise regimen.

Living With a Hernia
====================

It's doable but I don't recommend it.

If I walk or exercise, then I have to wear a brace. That brace gets
uncomfortable the longer I wear it, but it's better than the
alternative. It's risky for me to max out my weights unless I'm on a
machine. I can't do any direct abdominal exercises.

Without the brace I'm not supposed to lift anything heavier than 15
pounds. Ugh.

The Part I Really Don't Like
=============================

I'm scared.

Logically I know it's a low risk operation done millions of times a
year around the world. That my surgeon is rated extremely well. Still,
it's me going under general anesthesia so a really nice lady can cut
holes in me.

So I'm scared.

I try not to think about it, the same way I ignored the injury during
most of my time in Europe. So far it's been working pretty well, except
when I'm driving or trying to sleep.

PyCon in Montreal
=================

We're not going. We weren't going because of finances, work, etc., but
the scheduled surgery cemented it.

Wish Me Luck!
=============

I can't wait for this to be done and finished. I want to be able to do
things again. To walk and run for hours with no more discomfort than
aching feet. To be able to pick things up.

It's going to be delightful.

One more thing: next time I'm hiring movers.
