title: Want to work for Eventbrite?
---

Join me, [Andrew Godwin](https://www.aeracode.org/) (South, [Django
migrations](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.7/topics/migrations/)),
[Simon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Willison)
[Willison](https://blog.simonwillison.net/) (co-founder of
[Django](https://djangoproject.com), co-founder of
[Lanyrd](https://lanyrd.com/)), and many other talented people at
[Eventbrite](https://eventbrite.com). We have great challenges, the kind
that inspire you to rise to the occasion. We need you to help us
overcome them.

I should mention that Eventbrite is committed to giving back to the
community. Most notably [Eventbrite just contributed £5000 to the Django
Rest Framework
kickstarter](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tomchristie/django-rest-framework-3/posts/921581),
or about **US$8500!!** We're a frequent sponsor of events around the
world. It doesn't stop there, as Eventbrite managers during the
discussion of any tool outside our domain of running events will ask:
"_When can we open source this?_"

As someone who loves working on open source, Eventbrite is the place to
be. I say this because I know what we're planning to do in the future.
If you join us, you'll find out sooner rather than later. ;)

What's Eventbrite like as a company? Well, we're rated in the **top 20
of best places to work** in the United States. We get full benefits,
free lunch, educational opportunities, and much more. In addition, I
have to say that my co-workers are friendly, intelligent, always
learning, and love to do things the right way, even if it's the hard
way.

# Applying for Eventbrite Python positions

Sure, you could go to the official Eventbrite job site, but this method
is a fun challenge that proves to us you have the basics down. All you
need to do is pass this little test of mine. If you fail any portion of
this test we can't consider hiring you.

1.  **Can you work** in **San Francisco** (USA), **Nashville** (USA), or
    **Mendoza** (Argentina)?
2.  **Do you know Python?** Sorry, we aren't looking for Foxpro coders.
    Experience with git-scm, CSS, JavaScript, Django, and MySQL definite
    pluses.
3.  **Are you able to communicate in both written and verbal English?**
4.  **Are you a coder?** I will throw away anything from a recruiter.
5.  **Can you figure out how to contact me?** Eventbrite doesn't
    believe in testing applicants with puzzle logic questions. Instead,
    we ask you meaningful technical questions or to solve a coding
    problem. With that in mind, use the following to contact me:

    hints: chr, problem solving, list comprehension

**Note:** This is the updated test that is identical to my next blog
post.

Good luck!
